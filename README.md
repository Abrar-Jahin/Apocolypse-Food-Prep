## Review of Power BI Basics

### Building First Visualization
The initial steps of the tutorial focused on building the first visualization in Power BI. This included:
- Understanding the Power BI interface and workspace.
- Importing data into Power BI from various sources.
- Creating a simple yet informative visualization, such as a bar chart or a line graph, to represent the imported data.

### Using Power Query in Power BI
Power Query, an essential tool in Power BI for data transformation and cleaning, was thoroughly covered:
- Exploring the functionalities of Power Query to shape and refine the imported data.
- Applying transformations like removing duplicates, changing data types, and filtering data rows.

### Creating and Managing Relationships in Power BI
Establishing relationships between different data tables is crucial for accurate analysis:
- Learning how to create relationships based on common fields between tables.
- Managing and editing relationships to ensure data integrity and proper analysis flow.

### Using DAX in Power BI
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a powerful language used for creating calculated columns and measures:
- Understanding the basics of DAX syntax and functions.
- Creating calculated columns to derive new insights from existing data.
- Building measures for dynamic and interactive analysis.

### Using Drill Down in Power BI
Drill Down functionality allows users to delve deeper into hierarchical data structures:
- Exploring how to create drill-down reports for detailed analysis.
- Using drill-down features to navigate through different levels of summarized data.

### Using Conditional Formatting in Power BI
Conditional formatting enhances visualizations by highlighting important data points:
- Applying conditional formatting rules to change colors, font styles, and data point sizes based on specified criteria.
- Making visualizations more intuitive and easy to interpret.

### Using Bins and Lists in Power BI
Bins and lists are useful for grouping and categorizing data into manageable segments:
- Creating bins to group numerical data into predefined ranges for analysis.
- Utilizing lists to categorize data into custom groups for better organization.

### Popular Visualizations in Power BI
The tutorial also showcased various popular visualizations that can be created in Power BI:
- Exploring common types such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and scatter plots.
- Understanding when and how to use each visualization type based on the data and the insights to be communicated.
